# Forest plots with ggplot2

Flexible forest plots using ggplot2 - easier to adapt, both in terms of visuals and extra information (e.g. study characteristics).

Based on a post by Katherine Hoffman (https://www.khstats.com/blog/forest-plots/), using 𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑎𝑓𝑜𝑟, 𝑔𝑔𝑝𝑙𝑜𝑡2, and 𝑝𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘.

Currently, in works for a systematic review on seizure forecasting.
